The data consists of the following attributes:<br>
1. trip_creation_time – Timestamp of trip creation<br>
2. route_schedule_uuid – Unique Id for a particular route schedule<br>
3. route_type – Transportation type<br>
   FTL – Full Truck Load: FTL shipments get to the destination sooner, as the truck is making no other pickups or drop-offs along the way
   Carting: Handling system consisting of small vehicles (carts)<br>
4.trip_uuid - Unique ID given to a particular trip (A trip may include different source and destination centers)<br>
5.source_center - Source ID of trip origin<br>
6.source_name - Source Name of trip origin<br>
7.destination_cente – Destination ID<br>
8.destination_name – Destination Name<br>
9.od_start_time – Trip start time<br>
10.od_end_time – Trip end time<br>
11.start_scan_to_end_scan – Time taken to deliver from source to destination<br>
12.actual_distance_to_destination – Distance in Kms between source and destination warehouse<br>
13.actual_time – Actual time taken to complete the delivery (Cumulative)<br>
14.osrm_time – An open-source routing engine time calculator which computes the shortest path between points in a given map<br>
15.osrm_distance – An open-source routing engine which computes the shortest path between points in a given map (Includes usual traffic, distance through major and minor roads<br>
16.segment_actual_time – This is a segment time. Time taken by the subset of the package delivery<br>
17.segment_osrm_time – This is the OSRM segment time. Time taken by the subset of the package delivery<br>
